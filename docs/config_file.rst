Processing Configuration
========================
Basic configuration paramters, in particular directory paths,
are stored in a configuration file used by both data extraction 
script and the XML interpreter.

The file is UTF-8 encoded and follows the MS INI format:

.. code-block:: ini

    [RawData]
    raw_data_path       = ../raw-data/
    mask                = CR1000_*.dat
    logger_time_zone    = UTC+1

    [Metadata]
    Project      = My project name
    Web Page     = http://my-project.org/
    File Content = Data acquired during My Project
    Owner        = Myself
    Contact      = me@my-email.com
    Comment      = Data are provided without warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.

    [Files]
    data_path           = ./    
    xml_dtd_out         = data_map.dtd
    raw_data            = consolidated_raw_data.npy
    processed_data_xlsx = processed_data.xlsx
    processed_data_npy  = processed_data.npy
    xml_map_path        = ./
    xml_map             = data_map.xml
    
RawData
^^^^^^^
The ``RawData`` section is used only by the data extraction tool.

* ``raw_data_path`` specifies the path to the Campbell Scientific 
  TOA5 raw data files generated by LoggerNet.
* ``mask`` is the file name mast (glob) of the TOA5 raw data files
  that should be imported.
* ``logger_time_zone`` is a string that is copied into the output file

Metadata
^^^^^^^^
The ``Metadata`` section is used by the XML interpreter. The keys 
and values are copied into the output XLSX file ahead of the data 
table.

Files
^^^^^
The ``Files`` section is used by both raw data extraction tool 
and XML interpreter:

* ``data_path`` specifies where intermediate and final files
  will be stored.
* ``raw_data`` specifies the name of the file generated by
  the TOA5 raw data extraction tool.
* ``processed_data_xlsx`` and ``processed_data_npy`` are
  the names of the files that store the result of XML
  interpreter.
* ``xml_dtd_out`` names the file the XML interpreter
  stores the DTD in.
* ``xml_map_path`` (optional) is the path to the 
  XML Data File. If not specified, ``data_path`` is
  assumed.
* ``xml_map`` is the input XML Data File for the XML
  interpreter.
